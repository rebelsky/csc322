Frequently (and not-so-frequently) Asked Questions
==================================================

These are my attempts to answer some questions that students have asked.
(in the first assignment, in office hours, via email, etc.)

Note that there may be some repetition on this page.

About the Site
--------------

_The daily eboards look much nicer than what you type in class.  How
do I see what you type in class?_

> Replace the `.html` at the end with `.md`.

_What technology do you use to build the course web?_

> I use two markup languages.  For many of the pages (e.g., readings,
  labs) I use a form of XML called Docbook.  But Docbook is wordy, so
  for other pages (e.g., the daily outlines and eboards), I use
  Markdown.  I also have a bunch of scripts to help with all of this.
  You can find the scripts and source code on GitHub.

_Parts of the site don't seem quite as robust as your normal course webs.
 What's up with that?_

> Although I worked on the course over the summer, I'm dealing with both
  three new classes (and a revision of CSC 151) and administrative
  responsibilities.  Expect the site to evolve over time.

About the Course
----------------

About the Projects
------------------

_I hear that one project was completed last spring.  What are the
implications?_

> Yes, the Food Bank project was completed in Spring 2015.  Members
  of that team will be working with MICA to roll it out this fall.
  I take it as a good sign that we can get a project out in a year.

> MICA has suggested a new project to replace the Food Bank and
  we'll be starting it that semester.

About Other Things
------------------

_Do we have to use Github for our code?_

> Yes.

_Do we have to release our code under an open-source license?_

> Yes.  The tradition within the Rails community seems to be the
  [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
