Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* One group still needs money.
* Don't forget that you have Monday presentations.
* Wednesday and Friday are work time.  Please plan how you will use that
  time to your best advantage.  (E.g., meetings with clients or mentors.
  Exploring code base.  Drinking coffee.)
* I have not yet heard a revised meeting date from MICA.
