_Susan Sanning is our community outreach coordinator with CLS._

Question: What does our community think about Grinnell Colelge students?

* Rich, privileged
* Raucous
* Drink a lot
* Super liberal
* Self-centered
* Think they can walk in the middle of the street whenever they want

How about positives?

* Study hard
* Smart, really smart
* Volunteer a lot
* Access to skills that don't necessarily exist in our community

On that last item

* In a larger city, many of the things our class (and other classes) do 
  would be done by a local company or consultant or ...
* You have a chance to effect this community

Grinnell trivia (that is not trivial)

* What is the unemployment rate in this community?  12% 30% 6%.  It's 2-3%
* What is the poverty rate in this community?  20%  30%  15%.  Depending on
  who you ask it's between 30% and 60%.  About 40% of our students are on
  free and reduced lunches.
* Our community members are chronically underemployed/underpaid, working
  multiple jobs, and don't have a lot of time to do things.
* Who has access to Internet in our community?  Poverty is an issue.
  Rurality is an issue.  Transportation is an issue.
* There is a lot of consolidation and putting things online.
* $400+/month for 30 gb rural Internet connections (ouch!)
* For the MICA projects, we should be paying a lot of attention to bandwidth
  and related issues.

Why are you here?

* Required.
* Making a difference seems important.  Like doing something impactful.
* Learn about making software.
* Make things that people will use.
* Applicable skills.
* Looks good on my resume.
* Assorted other ones that I can't hear.

What will be harder in terms of working with clients?

* People who understand less about technology.  That means we have to
  work on 
    * communication skills 
    * translation
    * managing expectations
    * higher standards / mistakes have different implications
* Time management 
    * Certain times of day
    * Need to make appointments
    * Need to communicate when you need to push deadlines because, for
      example, you've found a glitch
    * Missing things has a cascade effect
    * And you are taking them away from important things, so use their
      time wisely.
* Assess professional dress.
* Communication: 
    * Should you text at 3am?  Probably not, unless they say that they
      turn their phones off.
    * Better: Email, phone call, *whatever they tell you*
    * Lead time!  How much do you need?
* Think about Iowa Nice!
* Ask people about response windows!
* "Sam plans differently"

What do you know about GPCF?

* Granting organization
* Provides back-office support for nonprofits.  How do I help the
  organizations that I give to run better?
* All non-profits must have a board of directors.
* Grant application management systems cost a lot of money
* Our nonprofits are funded by grants, so it's important that they get
  funding.

Head Start

* Makes preschool accessible to those who might not otherwise have access
* Provides access to resources that might not otherwise be available
  (to both kids and their families)

Resource Guide

* How is information disseminated in rural small town America ... word
  of mouth, churches, etc.
* There isn't a good one-stop shop for finding out about resources.
* Even those who provide support don't know all of the resources.

Transportation

* Most of the time, you can walk.
* We have a request form for transportation.  48 business hours ahead
  of time.
    * 19+ plus two-years of clean driving record lets you sign up  
      to drive
    * Certified driver is a paid gig.
* Go in groups

Opportunities

* We have service-learning work-study positions.  Next semester you
  can get paid to support the rollout/launch of the project.

Other Notes

* Kristina Weber can be a resource for folks working with MICA.
* Danielle is incredibly busy ... oversees five different sites.
  Good at setting boundaries.
* Chris Hunter from Sociology is on the board of MICA.
* Jamie Chambers from MICA/Marshalltown is our tech contact.
* Good question: Who else in your organization should we talk to?
* We need to think about confidentiality agreements.
