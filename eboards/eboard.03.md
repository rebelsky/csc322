### Questions

User stories
------------

* What are they?
    * An account of what a user wants to do with the system.
      "As a BLANK I want to BLANK so that I can BLANKETY BLANK.
    * As a mother of three I want to search for cheap groceries
      so that I can feed my family.
    * The language you use is important!
    * As a grant reviewer I want to be able to review multiple
      applications for multiple grants efficiently so that I can
      help select a grant recipient.
    * As a parent, I want reminders of expected appointments so that
      I can make those appointments and maintain eligibility.
    * As a potential board member, I want to be able to describe my skills
      so that organizations can identify my skills.
    * As a potential board member, I want to be able to submit my resume,
      so that I don't have to retype things in describing my skills.
* How do we build them?
    * Talk to our clients.  (And *listen to* our clients.)  (Sometimes
      simulate our clients.)
    * Synthesize into something more concise.
    * Make sure that they are the right size.  Often break into smaller 
      stories.
    * Discuss with client to make sure that they represent what the
      client wants.
* How do we use them?
    * Prioritize work.
    * Sometimes break into tasks.
    * Think more closely about audience.
    * Track your project - Let's you see how much work you've accomplished
      (or that you've accomplished work).
    * Estimate your work.

User stories exercise
---------------------

_You are building the Grinnell online teaching system (GOTS) for the Ruby
programming language_

* Whole group question: Who are your audiences?
    * Grinnell students - use the system
    * Professors/A - Keep track of student learning
    * Professors/B - Content providers
    * Any students, anywhere, anytime
    * CS novices
    * CS students
    * Trustees / Administrators (are these just stakeholders)
    * Professional Software Engineers
    * Alums
* We will break into individual groups to conduct user interviews.  NBB
  and I will simulate certain kinds of users.  Others of you will have to
  simulate others.
* We will come back together with the stories we have gathered.
* Strive for relatively small/narrow stories.  Not "As a student, I want to
  learn." or "As a College official, I want to publicize the College so that
  I can recruit more full-pay students." (Well, maybe the latter.)
* Some stories:
    * "As a teacher, I want to be able to send email to my students who
       have fallen behind, encouraging them to keep trying and catch up."
    * "As a first-year football player, I want to explore whether or not
       I am interested in CS."
* Some concerns
    * Moving forward into "I see us *doing this*" rather than listening
      carefully to the stories and asking them to say more.

Plan for client meetings / Small-group r&eacute;sum&eacute; reviews
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Reread the r&ecaute;ume&eacute;s of the folks in your group, keeping
the following questions in mind.

* What story does the r&ecaute;ume&eacute; tell?  (If you had to summarize
  the person in two sentences based on this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;, what
  would you say?
* What is something in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; that you might adapt for
  your own r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?
* What makes this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; stand out from the others you read?
* What are two things you would improve in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?

Client meeting prep
-------------------

* What are important questions that you have for your client?
* Some starting ones:
    * "What do you see as the primary mission of your organization?"
    * "We are new" (or "this is a new project"); "Can you describe the
      goals of the project from your perspective?"
    * "What things do you think it is most important for the project 
      to do?"
    * ...

Client meetings
---------------

_Some students will head off to work with their clients._

R&ecaute;ume&eacute; reviews, continued
---------------------------------------

_The remaining students will look at global issues in their
r&ecaute;ume&eacute;s._

* Superhero names with alliteration are good; change your name.
    * Don't take career advice from Peter Parker or Matt Murdock or
      Bruce Banner or Bonald Blake
* Be consistent in your formatting - Don't make your resume look sloppy.
    * May be particularly important for computer science students -
      sloppy resumes can imply sloppy code.
* Find ways to condense repeated employers
    * E.g., one heading for the employer and subheaders underneath
* Use formatting tricks to highlight important information
    * E.g., boldface the languages that you know; make your
      position more readable than your employer (although for some
      employers, it could be good to have their name.
      `software developer at AMAZON CLOUD SERVICES!!!`
* Condense to one page ...?

Debrief: Working with Clients
-----------------------------

_Conducted by CLS. - Service, Social Justice, Sivic Engagement, and Stuff_

* Know when your clients are too enthusiastic about going along with
  you.  You have a responsibility to make sure that you push to hear
  their requirements.
* Be sure to know how people want to communicate with you - in our cases,
  everyone seems to be comfortable with email.
* Setting up regular times for email or whatever is useful.
* Some of our clients are very busy and very understaffed.
* Lots of things are done by word of mouth in our community.
