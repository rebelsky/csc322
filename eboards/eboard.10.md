Preliminaries
-------------

* No longer beware the Wasp
* Friday PSA

### Admin

* I'd like us to use Mondays as group check-ins.
    * Each group should describe the tasks that they are currently working
      on, the points assigned to each tasks, and so on and so forth.
* We'll spend some of today talking about managing and working in groups.

### Questions

Thinking About Group Work
-------------------------

We all know the problems ...

* You divide the work.  You go our separate ways.  You come back
  together.
    * No one else did any work, so I have have to scramble to finish.
    * One of my teammates didn't trust us, did all the work, and refuses
      to use what anyone else did.

So, we should think about ...

* How do we make sure that every group member contributes?
    * Sam gives each of us 80 points to assign as we will within the
      group, except to ourselves.  The number of points assigned to
      you is your grade.
    * Record what each person is supposed to do and check in regularly.
      (Use Trello)
    * Work in pairs.
    * Check in regularly.
* How do we make sure that every group member can contribute?

Warning for Monday
------------------

* 10 minutes of planning
* Then each gruop presents for ten minutes.
