Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Today: Group check-ins!
    * Each group should describe the tasks that they are currently working
      on, the points assigned to each task, and so on and so forth.
* Wednesday and Friday are work time.  Please plan how you will use that
  time to your best advantage.  (E.g., meetings with clients or mentors.
  Exploring code base.  Drinking coffee.)
* I have not yet heard a revised meeting date from MICA.
* I forgot to bring money.  I'll try to remember on Wednesday.

### Questions

Weekly Reports
--------------

Starting this week, every Sunday night each group should send a weekly
report to me and to *all* the mentors (not just yours).  The report
should cover the following four points.

* What did you accomplish during the past week?
* What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
* What obstacles stand in your way?
* What resources will help you accomplish your task?

Presentation Format
-------------------

We will have presentations every week on Monday.  We'll alternate between
quick presentations (next week) and more substantive presentations in
which we conclude one iteration and start the next.  Today's will fall
somewhere in between.

* _Intended Goals_.  Remind us of your goals for the time period and
  the points you associated with those goals.
* _Overview of Accomplishments_.  Which of those goals did you accomplish?
  What other (unexpected) things did you deal with along the way?
* _Demo_.  Show off the current state of your system, focusing on the
  parts you were working on.
* _Code Walkthrough_.  Show us an interesting part of your code from the
  past two weeks and explain it to us.  
* _New Goals_.  What do you intend to accomplish over the next 
  two-week iteration? What points have you assigned to each task?
  How are you dividing the work?

Please strive for organized and coherent presentations.

Time To Prepare Presentations
-----------------------------

You will have some time to work on your presentations.

* Trello can help for showing tasks.
