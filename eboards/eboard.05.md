Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Weekly reports (to me and to all four alums)
    * What did you plan to do this week?
    * What did you spend your time on this week?
        * Yes, you need to write down things like "I spent two hours
          following this Ruby Tutorial before realizing it was for the
          wrong version of Ruby."
    * What obstacles made it difficult for you to move forward? 
    * What do you plan to do this coming week?
    * What help do you need for this coming week?
    * Anything else of interest.
* Check ins!
    * When are your scheduled meetings with your community partners?
        * Grants: Forthcoming.
        * Resource Guide: EM tomorrow (hopefully).  DW or JA next week.
        * Notifications Team: Forthcoming.
        * Board Bank: Forthcoming.
        * These can be during class time (after 2pm)
        * With advance notice, SS can get you transportation.  (SR may
          be able to provide transportation in the mean time.)
    * When are your scheduled meetings with your mentors?
        * Grants: 5pm on Sunday
        * Resources: None yet.
        * Notifications: Every Thursday at 2pm
        * Board Bank: Two-week, related to iterations.  Thursday.
* We'll take a quick look at the schedule.
* For the second half of today's class, you will be in workgroups and
  Nora and I will be wandering around thing to help.  (I may stop early
  to make sure that my talk is ready.)

### Questions

Debrief on learning from alumni
-------------------------------

* Metrics for success.  
    * You will be successful if you have learned something and can
      communicate what you have learned.
    * You will be successful if you have a better idea whether or not
      WebDev is something you want to pursue in the future.
* Rails follows an MVC framework.
* Thinking about databases and table relationships (forthcoming in 321)
    * Understand functional needs of your program
    * From that develop tables.
    * Think about the different kinds of relationships: 1-1, 1-many,
      many-many.  (Ask the Resouce Guide group for how to model these).
* State machines are interesting.  (Although not necessarily for this
  project.)  But it's also useful for general analysis of software
  as you build or understand someone else's software.
    * Idea: Things can be in multiple states and there are transitions
      between states with associated actions.
    * Example: Vending machine.  Initial state is "No money".  Adding
      a coin converts it to "some money".  Adding enough coins converts
      it to "enough money to buy a product", so it enables various
      "purchase" buttons.  Purchasing has additional effects.
* UX analysis through a particular role (e.g., reviewer, applicant, admin).
  Reviewing the completed user stories by interacting with the app, may
  possibly generate new user stories.
* Particular project issues (e.g., Paperclip + Dropbox)
* The importance of products like Trello to manage projects online.
* More details of project - e.g., the database design.
* The ActiveAdmin Gem makes it easier to add administration privs for a
  Rails app.
* Rails makes things easy, but chasing Rails/Ruby updates is a PITN.
* TDD!
* Version control is important!  Use it!  Branches are your friends.
* RFC2616 - Know HTTP.
