Preliminaries

### Admin

  development part of CSC 322; (b) I think it helps in team building;
  (c) We'll have someone here on Thursday talking about tech 
  resumes, so developing questions would be good; and (d) Janet put
  it in the class structure.

### Homework (for Wednesday)

  project.

      of Age in America_ by visiting Macy 203 during regular office times.

### Questions

Strengths quest
---------------

* Positives
    * Under the premise that this is correct, some of the teams feel
      very imbalanced.
* Negatives
    * Felt like a rushed experience, and then you get pegged into
      certain categories.  Felt strange.  (Goal is to be rushed, to
      see what seems more 'natural' to you.)  (Unless your natural
      approach is analysis.)
    * Frustrating that there were often "both" and "neither".
    * Circular logic.
* Questions
    * Are all computer scientists strategic thinkers?
