Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Missing: BL
* Don't forget to submit weekly electronic reports on Wednesday nights.
  I only think I got two last night (Grant Board and Resource Portal).
* We will be working on bi-weekly in-class presentations, starting this week. 
  (Details in the outline/eboard.)
* It's probably time to check in with your clients and mentors, if you haven't
  done so already.  Clients should be in-person meetings; mentors will 
  probably be Skype.   I generally suggest the last hour or two of class
  for such meetings.
    * Do you have any planned meetings?
* Reminder: You have responsibility to your team; if you can't be in class,
  let them know in advance.

### Questions

Presentation Format
-------------------

These presentations will be every-other week, so that you have more work
time in the alternate weeks.

* _Intended Goals_.  Remind us of your goals for the time period and
  the points you associated with those goals.
* _Overview of Accomplishments_.  Which of those goals did you accomplish?
  What other (unexpected) things did you deal with along the way?  And
  what points would you assign to them?
* _Demo_.  Show off the current state of your system, focusing on the
  parts you were working on.
* _Code Walkthrough_.  Show us an interesting part of your code from the
  past two weeks and explain it to us.  (Optional today.)
* _New Goals_.  What do you intend to accomplish over the next 
  two-week iteration? What points have you assigned to each task?
  How are you dividing the work?
* _Questions_.  Questions to your peers.  Questions from your peers.

Please strive for organized and coherent presentations.
