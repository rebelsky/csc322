Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* I plan to do some transportation today at 2:30.
* I'll generally be around otherwise.
* Don't forget your weekly reports!
* Goal for next week: Cucumber Scenarios for your Projects 
    * They don't need to work, but they need to be in a form that we
      can look at them together
   
Cucumber basics
---------------

* We need to bridge the informality of user storiees with the formality
  of code.
* In an ideal world, the user writes down a story and we can automatically
  check whether it succeeds!
* Cucumber is a compromise
    * We write user stories in a language the user can understand
    * We will write regular expressions to match parts of those stories
    * We will translate those regular expressions to code
Work time
