### Questions

About strengths finder
----------------------

* Designed by Gallup.
* Versions for both school (Strengths Finder) and professional
  (Strengths Quest)
* Developed from school of positive psychology
* Helps you identify tendencies.
* Gallup talked to 1000s of CEOs and asked them what allowed them to
  do their best work.
* Gave them 300 qualities ("talents").
* Refined that list to 34 qualitities ("themes").
* Data is at their Web site.
* They rank all 34 depending on your responses.
* You can do all of them.  But you can likely pick up the top ones more
  quickly.
* Should you spend your energy on something you are poor at, which may
  make you average, or something you are good or aveage at, which may make
  you great.
* "Talent" - Natural ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving.
* Multiply by Investment - Things to build the skill. 
* That gives you a strength.
* "Strength" - Ability to consistently perform at near-perfect levels.
* Each strength has five characteristics
    1. Yearnings
    2. Satisfactions (maybe an element of joy or fulfillment)
    3. Rapid learning
    4. Glimpses of excellence (compared to the average person); you
       stand out compared to the average person
    5. Total performance
* These could also be characteristics of talents, but they are likely
  to lead you to invest and build it toward a strength.
* Exercise: Write your name five times with each hand
    * We are all much faster with our dominant hand
* My strengths and how to use them.

Interpreting strengths finder results
-------------------------------------

* Bring up your five strengths (Sam is Learner, Strategic, Achiever,
  Activator, and Ideation)
* For each, give
    * how you define it
    * what it empowers you to do
    * an example of how the strength came out today
* [Exercise: Chat with each other.]
* Scavenger hunt!
    * Repeatedly: Find someone with a different strength and find out
      what it means to them.
* How do your strengths match in your team specifically?
* We have a page that lets us look at these issues.  Fill in your
  group's sheets.
