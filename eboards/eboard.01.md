Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Welcome back.  I hope you had spectacular summers!
* Congratulations.  You are already among the most responsible classes 
  I have taught.
* Any activities that would benefit from peer support?
* CS Table *Tuesday*!  Topic TBD.
* New department academic honesty policy available at
  <http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/academic-honesty-policy>.
* Upcoming work
    * Submit r&eacute;sum&eacute;s by next week's class.
    * Submit ordered list of project preferences by Monday at 5pm.
* Attendance.

### Questions

* Workload?
    * In class three hours per week
    * Outside of class three-four hours per week
* How will these products be maintained?
    * One year: Hourly wage through Susan Sanning's office
    * After that, we hand off

Quick Course Overview
---------------------

* Building moderate sized projects.
* In a team.
* With community partners on NON-MISSION-CRITICAL projects
* With supervision from alumni mentors
* Using agile methodologies

Why This Course?
----------------

* "To do things with real world applications."
    * More experience
    * Contribute to society!  (Yes, computer scientists build more
      than evil spam filters that spy on you.)
* Give structure to process of building software
    * Ground the theory from 321 in real practice

The Projects
------------

* What is the project?
* Who is the client?
* In what stage is the project?
* Why should people want to work on this project?

### Board Bank - NBB

* Work with the Greater Poweshiek Community Foundation
    * they work with a lot of other organizations
* Those organizations need people for their boards
* We are creating a bank of information about people who would
  be willing to work on boards.
    * Boards can then search the information. 
* Current status:
    * Able to create profiles (as organizations and profiles)
    * Able to view organization and user profiles
    * Able to filter in various ways
* Main project goals
    * Need a search function to reach the minimum viable product
* Additional goals
    * Regular email to remind people to update their profiles
    * Download lists of users
    * Import information from LinkedIn
    * Let admins get analytics
* Why should you work on this?
    * Learning how to implement search will be useful in many
      situations.
    * The partner is helpful and excited about the project.
    * Should be ready for rollout this semester.

Side note: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

* The basic set of core features that need to be there in order for
  the product to be usable.

### Notification System

* A way for administrators and teachers to get in touch with parents
  (e.g., about closings).
* Client: Mid-Iowa Community Actions (MICA)
    * Primary target within MICA, Head Start
* Close to rollout; may be in use already?  We need to communicate with
  them about that.
* Needed for MVP:
    * Separate user roles.
    * Easy account creation.
    * Better UI so less training is necessary.
* Used a cool API for doing text messaging.
* Why should you work on this?
    * Work with cool APIs?
    * UI design opportunities
    * Could spend some of semester in rollout
    * Wes is an awesome mentor and is relatively nearby (Iowa City)

### Grant Review System

* People have applied for funding.  Current model is based around
  Google docs.  Very ad hoc.
* Building a way for people to submit, update applications, reviewers
  read and score applications, perhaps provide additional information.
* Relatively early in the project - restarted last semester.
* Work with GPCF.
* One of the big roadblocks last semester was file uploads; they have
  made some progress.
* Lots of usability issues to work on.
* Why this project?
    * Early on in a project, but not the absolute beginning.
    * Returning members!

Support Repository 

* PDF document of support services
* Need easy way to access more easily and with less data
* Mid-Iowa Community Action
* Why work on this project?
    * Just beginning.  You get to do big architectural design!
    * Think about how you make it easy to add and organize information
      for non-specialists
    * Make a difference in people's lives
    * Work with vague requirements.

Why This Course?
----------------

* We're used to working with careful requirements.  Working with a 
  community partner learn how to turn vague requirements into 
  better specifications.
* Build additional skills, not just coding:
    * Working in teams
    * Communicate better
        * Team members
        * Client - community representative
            * Less technically savvy
        * Mentor/supervisor (alumni, Sam)
        * Users (perhaps through client, perhaps directly)
        * Your successors - How do you inform people who you won't
          necessarily meet about all the important aspects of your
          project?
        * Your peers (in the class and in the department)
* Build your portfolio

Strengths Finder
----------------

* Welcome to Kelly Guilbeau from the CLS!
* StrengthsFinder and StrengthsQuest are the same assessment,
  but they give different kinds of reports.
    * Educational (what we did)
* *Whoops!  Sam stopped typing.*

    * This week: Learn a little about the class and each other
