  position in the last set of presentations.)

### Questions

Presentation Format
-------------------

We will have presentations every week.  We'll alternate between quick
presentations (next week) and more substantive presentations.  Today's
is a substantive presentation.

* _Intended Goals_.  Remind us of your goals for the time period and
  the points you associated with those goals.
* _Overview of Accomplishments_.  Which of those goals did you accomplish?
  What other (unexpected) things did you deal with along the way?
* _Demo_.  Show off the current state of your system, focusing on the
  parts you were working on.
* _Code Walkthrough_.  Show us an interesting part of your code from the
  past two weeks and explain it to us.  (Optional today.)
* _New Goals_.  What do you intend to accomplish over the next 
  two-week iteration? What points have you assigned to each task?
  How are you dividing the work?

Please strive for organized and coherent presentations.

Time To Prepare Presentations
