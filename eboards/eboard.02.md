Preliminaries
-------------

### Admin

* Apologies for late notification about r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.
    * My strengths are clearly last-minute improv, and not careful
      pre-planning.
* Project teams formed.
* Alumni visits confirmed for the 17th.  Plan on lunch and dinner with alums,
  if at all possible!
* Work for next week: 
    * Everyone - Overviews of existing codebase - questions, ideas, notes, etc.
        * Resource bank can look at the food pantry code.
    * Board Bank and Grants - Plans for meeting with Ahrens.
* I need someone to work on the simple maintenance of MIST - making sure
  to reboot if it's crashed, gathering usage data, posting things to 
  Facebook, maybe fixing bugs when they appear, whatever.  1-2 hpw max.
  Any interest?  (If so, let me know and apply through PioneerLink.)

### Questions

Team formation
--------------

* Quick intro.
* Read each other's resumes.
* Discuss: What have you learned about each other from the resumes?
* Fill in strengths chart and discuss.
* Identify
    * Product owner: Liason with the client
    * ScrumMaster: (Project manager)
    * Other roles you consider appropriate

Working with clients
--------------------

* Understand the context of the community partner
* Don't assume that you know everything
* Meet with the community partner regularly
* First meeting: Have them outline the project in their own words and find
  out their goals.  (It's okay to do this for continuing projects, too.)
    * Understand the client's overall mission.
    * How does it relate to your mission?  Why is it important?
    * What do you want it to do?
    * What do you see as the greatest priority.
* Try to get some user stories - situational examples, personalized,
  of things that you want to do in the system
    * One reviewer needs to be able to review more than one project.
      As a reviewer, I need to be able to review not just multiple 
      applications, but applications for multiple grants, so that
      I can accomplish my task efficiently.
    * General format: As _____, I need to _____, so that I can _____.
* Reminder: Bring something for taking notes.  (If you use a computer
  to take notes, ask permission.)
* More from the first meeting:
    * Make sure to describe yourselves, perhaps explain why you are
      excited about the project.
* Need a way to prioritize tasks, using the client's input effectively.
* It's okay to ask for clarification later.
* Don't expect to know how to solve the problem immediately.
* Typical followup meeting
    * Describe progress (and problems/sticking points) - what's going on
    * Help set expectations
    * Provide list of possible next steps and get prioritization
    * Possibly demo
* These meetings should generally happen at the client's site of business.
* These people need ADVANCE ARRANGEMENT of meetings
* Both of our partners are happy to communicate via email.
* Use ONE POINT OF CONTACT.
* These are not technical people.  Avoid technical terms.
* SKETCHES can be helpful.
* Decomposing big projects into small pieces can be complicated, and
  communicating the decomposition is one of your challenges.

Client meeting prep time
------------------------

*No notes.*

R&ecaute;ume&eacute; reviews
----------------------------

*Disclaimer 1: While I review CVs for certain jobs, I do not typically
hire for the kinds of positions you may be seeking.*

*Disclaimer 2: Your resume is usually only part of your job search.
Contacts and cover letters can make a huge difference.*

*Disclaimer 3: Resumes go through multiple audiences.*

What story (or stories) does your resume tell?

* Observation: You want to tell different stories for different
  jobs.  You should have multiple resumes.
* Observation: Most CS majors want to tell the story that they
  are technically competent.  
    * What in the resume supports that?
    * What in the resume undermines that?

What are things in your colleagues' resumes that you'd reuse?

* Give the name of the MAP as part of the description.
* Prioritize appropriately.
* Use typography to better highlight things.
* Communicate technical details clearly.
* Communicate soft skills, too.  You can sneak them in "Worked with team
  to ...", "Working with client, developed ..."
* Communicating the programming languages you know.
* Break up technical skills into separate categories.
* Extend the margins [x2]

What are things in your colleagues' resumes that you think they should change.

* Use "teaching assistant" or "peer educator" rather than mentor

Questions and Thoughts

* Remember that you can't please everyone
* One page vs. multiple pages
* New information at the top or bottom?
