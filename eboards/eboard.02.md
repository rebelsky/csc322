### Questions

Debrief on client meetings
--------------------------

* We are going to have fun.
* We need introductions so that our visitor, Susan Sanning, can know about 
  people.
* "Portal" + "Pool" = "Resource Puddle"
* If Chaplain Sanning picks on you, she will give you absolution with
  chocolate or jelly bellies.
    * But you have to make a pilgrimage to CLS.
* We are going to talk about professionalism.
    * Don't behave like Sam.
    * It's not about how you dress, it's how you behave.
* What are the stereotypes of how Grinnell students are?
    * Intellectuals
    * No street smarts
    * Arrogant
    * Stoners
    * Liberals
    * "There's a reason that Dr. Rebelsky used to hand out bars of soap
      in her office."
    * Grinnellians wear t-shirts and pajama bottoms
    * Even worse time management skills than SamR - show up late;
      don't realize that other people have schedules
    * On the other hand, they communicate wonderfully
    * Militant in beliefs
    * Communicate - mostly via email, rather than 
* How do you think about local people?
    * How do they dress?  Button down or polo.
    * Time management.  "Rural, slow, laid back."
    * Eye contact: Yes. Nerve racking to some.  Avoided with others.
    * "Very white"
    * Friendly to your face
    * Communicate - Talking (f2f, phone, Herald Register); Facebook
    * Who has high-speed Internet service?  Only people in town.  
      Outside of town (five minute drive), no real Internet service.
* "Professionalism is all about knowing about the person."
* What should I wear to Ahrens Foundation/Greater Poweshiek Community
  Foundation (GPCF) and Mid-Iowa Community Action (MICA)
* GPCF
    * Founded by Claude Ahrens to grant money for community good
    * Now does back-office support for non-profits in town
* How do you form a board of directors?
    * ....
    * GPCF helps
    * You might need lawyer, financial person, etc.
    * Contact is Nicole Brua-Behrens
* MICA - Mid-Iowa Community Action
    * Center point for helping people in the community
    * Both direct help and referral
    * A clearing house for resources to help people in poverty
    * The Resource Puddle is digitizing this
    * Primarily serves five counties: Hardin, Marshall, Poweshiek, Story, 
      and Tama
    * Contacts Danielle Wonderly (director) / Lindsey Fujimoto (intern;
      start here) / Jamie Adkins (tech liason)
* Why the Resource Puddle/Portal is important
    * Counselors may assumptions about what you as an individual need; by
      giving people direct access you empower them to figure out their own
      kinds of support.
* Head Start
    * Works through MICA
* What would Professional Dress be for GPCF?  Khakis and button-down shirt.
  Be aware of what your dress says in the context you are in.  Put forth
  a professional image.
* Smell is important.
* Be aware.
* Don't be self conscious, be self aware.  And point them out to each other.
* Self Gov says that you have to tell your fellow students about their
  annoying habits so that they don't screw up in interviews.
* Firm handshakes, no limp stuff.
* Know peoples' names.
* Assume that you should address people by last name (with Mr. and Ms.).
* Susan knows our community partners well; so she can help

Good questions for your clients

* How should we contact you?  (Phone, email, ....)
* How much advance notice do you want for meetings?
* If I send you a question, when do I need a response?

Transportation and More

* You get priority, particularly for site visits
* You may need to meet with Jamie in Marshalltown
* You may need to go to the Head Start buildings
* We would prefer that you use college vehicles
* sannings@grinnell.edu

More things with Susan

* You can use Susan as a resource.  She's overbooked, but she prioritizes
  students.
* You (can) make a huge difference in this community.

Plan for client meetings
------------------------

Sam will meet the board bank out front (8th) at 2:50 and the grant board team
out front a little after 3pm.  The resource puddle will transport the other
two groups.

* "What do you see as the primary mission of your organization?"
* "We are new" (or "this is a new project"); "Can you describe the
  goals of the project from your perspective?"
* "What things do you think it is most important for the project 
  to do?"
* "What are things that went well or less well with the previous group
  of students?"
* "We are basing our project on particular assumptions.  What assumptions 
  have been made that seem a bit inaccurate?"

For Head Start and Resource Group

* "What do you see as the language potential issues for our project?"

For Head Start

* "When would be a good time to meet with the (other) Head Start people?"
