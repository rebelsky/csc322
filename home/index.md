Introduction
------------

Welcome to the Fall 2016 section of Grinnell College's CSC 322, *Team Software
Development for Community Organizations*.  CSC 322 is an opportunity for
you to apply the ideas and tools you learned in CSC 321 and elsewhere in
our curriculum to real-world problems.  In particular, in CSC 322 we build
software projects that support organizations in our local community.  This
semester we will be working on projects for both the Ahrens Community
Foundation and Mid-Iowa Community Action (MICA).

This semester, we are trying a new model for the course.  Instead of one
three-hour meeting each week, we will be having three one-hour meetings
each week for the first half of the semester, and three two-hour meetings
each week for the second half of the semester.  This approach gives you
the opportunity to "ramp up" in how you work on the material.

Catalog Description
-------------------

Application of software development principles and practices to
a large-scale project. Teams of 3-6 students build software for a
community organization, supported by a faculty adviser and an alumni
technical mentor. Students will gain experience working with a client and
building a substantial code base suitable for inclusion in a professional
portfolio. Students are encouraged to repeat the course for credit
to experience multiple roles within a team and multiple phases of the
software lifecycle.

Course Goals and Structure
--------------------------

In this course, you will apply agile software development principles and
practices to a large-scale, ongoing, team project. To motivate and provide
context for the work, projects will serve a community organization. To
provide technical expertise and professional perspective, alumni mentors
will draw upon their practical software development experience.

You will gain experience with the complexities of real-world software
development: communicating with clients; working as part of a team;
self-directed technical learning; creating a substantial project from
scratch, or learning an existing code base; making design decisions
that may have long-term consequences; managing a large code base;
addressing pragmatic and ethical dilemmas. You will be able to draw
upon these experiences in pursuing academic or industry positions. By
sharing your source code through GitHub, you will make a substantial
beginning or addition to your professional portfolio. You will develop
professional skills and perspectives.

The class will meet once weekly for a three-hour lab block over the
14-week semester. During most weeks you will be expected to meet and
work for an additional three or four hours outside of class. There will
be few readings and no examinations. Work will be student-directed;
the instructor and alumni mentors will serve as consultants.

Over the semester, your project will develop as follows:

* In the first week, students from last semester or designated alternates
  will present ongoing and new projects.  You will then provide me with
  preferences for your projects. 
* In the second week, you will learn which project you are assigned to and
  form your team.  We will also share r&eacute;sum&acute;s and prepare to 
  meet with your community partners.
* In the next few weeks, you will become acquainted with the community
  partner(s), alumni mentor, and existing code.
* The next nine weeks of the semester will be divided into four two-week 
  iterations (with an extra week at the beginning). 
    * At the beginning of each iteration, each team will plan tasks to complete 
      and write acceptance tests. 
    * At the end of each iteration, each team will demonstrate their working 
      software to the instructor, classmates, and (most importantly) the 
      community partner. The partner will provide feedback on work thus far 
      as well as new tasks or changes in priority. 
    * Each team will reflect together with their alumni mentor on what 
      worked well in that iteration, what did not go well, and what to do 
      differently in the next iteration.
* At the end of the semester, you will reflect upon, analyze, and
  synthesize your experiences in a portfolio consisting of your updated
  r&eacute;sum&eacute; and a few short essays pointing to evidence of
  your learning and accomplishments.  This portfolio, along with feedback
  from your peers and mentors, will provide the primary basis for your
  grade in the course.

This course is a companion to CSC 321, Software Development Principles
and Practices. In CSC 321, you will learn how to apply agile software
methodology to developing software as a service (SaaS) using the Ruby on
Rails framework. In this course, you will apply what you learned to a
large-scale, real-world project. If you take CSC 322 concurrently with
CSC 321, you will find that topics are introduced in CSC 321 just in
time to apply them in CSC 322.

Important Warnings
------------------

*Warning!*  I am teaching three new courses this fall (including this
one) as well as an extra-large section of CSC 151.  I am also serving
as department chair.  I have instituted a wellness schedule: Except
on weeks in which I have an exam to grade, I am limiting myself to two
hours of evening work and five hours of weekend work.

*Warning!*  This course exercises some different skills than other
CS courses.  You will need to work with other people on your team
as well as clients from outside Grinnell.  You will have to manage
your own time and arrangements.  

*Warning!*  Students report that the workload in CSC 322 can easily 
become more than is appropriate for a 2-credit course, particularly
since they find value in the work they are doing.  I will do my best
to give you credit for time spent on work (provided it is well documented)
rather than just particular outcomes.

*Warning!* Both the course and the platform are new to me.  Expect me
to be even less organized than normal.

Basics
------

*Meets*: MWF 2:00-3:00 or 1:00:3:00.  Our default location is 3819, but we will likely
be working in a variety of locations.  You should plan to spend about
six hours per week on this class, between in-class and out-of-class time.

Much of this course and the corresponding syllabus were developed using
Janet Davis's resources.  I think her for her careful development of the
course and her willingness to allow me to reuse her resources.
