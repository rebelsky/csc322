Cucumber Scenarios
------------------

Each group will present the new Cucumber scenarios they developed
(plus a few old ones, if we don't know them) and then indicate which
ones they are prioritizing for the week.

Work Time
---------

Work with your group on the project.  I'll wander through groups, giving
advice and answering questions.
