Weekly Reports
--------------

Start this week, every Sunday night each group should send a weekly
report to me and to *all* the mentors (not just yours).  The report
should cover the following four points.

* What did you accomplish during the past week?
* What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
* What obstacles stand in your way?
* What resources will help you accomplish your task?

Presentation Format
-------------------

We will have presentations every week.  We'll alternate between quick
presentations (next week) and more substantive presentations.  Today's
will fall somewhere in between.

* _Intended Goals_.  Remind us of your goals for the time period and
  the points you associated with those goals.
* _Overview of Accomplishments_.  Which of those goals did you accomplish?
  What other (unexpected) things did you deal with along the way?
* _Demo_.  Show off the current state of your system, focusing on the
  parts you were working on.
* _Code Walkthrough_.  Show us an interesting part of your code from the
  past two weeks and explain it to us.  (Optional today.)
* _New Goals_.  What do you intend to accomplish over the next 
  two-week iteration? What points have you assigned to each task?
  How are you dividing the work?

Please strive for organized and coherent presentations.
