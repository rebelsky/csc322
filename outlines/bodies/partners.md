User Stories
------------

* What are they?
* How do we build them?
* How do we use them?

User Stories Exercise
---------------------

_You are building the Grinnell online teaching system (GOTS) for the Ruby
programming language_

* Whole group question: Who are your audiences?
* We will break into individual groups to conduct user interviews.  NBB
  and I will simulate certain kinds of users.  Others of you will have to
  simulate others.
* We will come back together with the stories we have gathered.
* Strive for relatively small/narrow stories.  Not "As a student, I want to
  learn." or "As a College official, I want to publicize the College so that
  I can recruit more full-pay students." (Well, maybe the latter.)

R&ecaute;ume&eacute; reviews 
----------------------------

Reread the r&ecaute;ume&eacute;s of the folks in your group, keeping
the following questions in mind.

* What story does the r&ecaute;ume&eacute; tell?  (If you had to summarize
  the person in two sentences based on this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;, what
  would you say?
* What is something in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; that you might adapt for
  your own r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?
* What makes this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; stand out from the others you read?
* What are two things you would improve in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?

I will wander through groups.  

Client meeting prep
-------------------

* What are important questions that you have for your client?
* Some starting ones:
    * "What do you see as the primary mission of your organization?"
    * "We are new" (or "this is a new project"); "Can you describe the
      goals of the project from your perspective?"
    * "What things do you think it is most important for the project 
      to do?"
    * ...
