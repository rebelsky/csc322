Team formation
--------------

* Introduce yourself quickly to your team members.
* Read each other's R&ecaute;ume&eacute;'s.  Discuss what they tell
  you about the other members of your team.
* Fill in the team StrengthsQuest form.  (Those who did not participate
  in StrengthsQuest will have to guess their strengths.)
* Identify two team members to serve the following roles (text from 
  Janet Davis):
    * *Product Owner*: maintains the project vision,
      prioritizes user stories, and keeps an open line of communication
      with the customer. The product owner role will be held by one
      team member throughout the semester.
    * *ScrumMaster* (a.k.a. "Project Manager"): The team member who keeps 
      the team on task, facilitates team processes, and ensures the team 
      has the resources it needs to succeed. In this class, the
      ScrumMaster will also coordinate team communications with the
      alumni mentor. This role may rotate among members of the team in
      accordance with their interest, but the ScrumMaster and Product
      Owner roles should never be held by the same person.
* Discuss other roles members of the team can serve.  (Be prepared to share.)

Working with clients
--------------------

* This semester, you will be working with people outside the College.  You
  have a responsibility to make sure that they are satisfied
    * That you have made good use of their time.
    * That you understand their project and their goals.
* What are things you should keep in mind as you work with your commnity
  partner?
    * Discuss in small groups.
    * Share with the larger group.

R&ecaute;ume&eacute; reviews 
----------------------------

Reread the r&ecaute;ume&eacute;s of the folks in your group, keeping
the following questions in mind.

* What story does the r&ecaute;ume&eacute; tell?  (If you had to summarize
  the person in two sentences based on this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;, what
  would you say?
* What is something in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; that you might adapt for
  your own r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?
* What makes this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; stand out from the others you read?
* What are two things you would improve in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?

I will wander through groups.  I will also provide my own critiques in
next week's class.

Client meeting prep
-------------------

*Sorry that this is happening this week.*

* What are important questions that you have for your client?
* Some starting ones:
    * "We are new" (or "this is a new project"); "Can you describe the
      goals of the project from your perspective?"
    * "What things do you think it is most important for the project 
      to do?"
    * ...

Work time
---------

* Start reviewing project code on Github.
