* What are they?
* How do we build them?
* How do we use them?

User Stories Exercise
---------------------

_You are building a better four year planning system._

* Whole group question: Who are your audiences?
* We will break into individual groups to conduct user interviews.  
* We will come back together with the stories we have gathered.
* Strive for relatively small/narrow stories.
