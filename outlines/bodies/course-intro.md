  in StrengthsQuest will have to guess their strengths.)

R&ecaute;ume&eacute; reviews 
----------------------------

Reread the r&ecaute;ume&eacute;s of the folks in your group, keeping
the following questions in mind.

* What story does the r&ecaute;ume&eacute; tell?  (If you had to summarize
  the person in two sentences based on this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;, what
  would you say?
* What is something in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; that you might adapt for
  your own r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?
* What makes this r&ecaute;ume&eacute; stand out from the others you read?
* What are two things you would improve in this r&ecaute;ume&eacute;?

I will wander through groups.  I will also provide my own critiques in
next week's class.
