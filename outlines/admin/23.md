* Welcome back from break!
* It's time for a new iteration.
* Don't forget that your reports were due last night.
* For this half of the semester, we will meet for six hours per week.  
  That's about the right amount of time to spend per week on a 2-credit,
  full-semester course.  So you shouldn't worry too much about trying
  to do work outside of class (maybe an hour or so).
