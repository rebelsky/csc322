* Don't forget to submit weekly electornic reports on Wednesday nights.
  I only think I got two last night (Board Bank and Resource Portal).
* We will be working on bi-weekly in-class reports, starting this week.    
  (Details in the outline/eboard.)
* It's probably time to check in with your clients and mentors, if you haven't
  done so already.  Clients should be in-person meetings; mentors will 
  probably be Skype.   I generally suggest the last hour or two of class
  for such meetings.
