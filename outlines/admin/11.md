* Today is group check-ins!
    * Each group should describe the tasks that they are currently working
      on, the points assigned to each tasks, and so on and so forth.
* Wednesday and Friday are work time.  Please plan how you will use that
  time to your best advantage.  (E.g., meetings with clients or mentors.
  Exploring code base.  Drinking coffee.)
* I have not yet heard a revised meeting date from MICA.
