* Remember: You should be spending three-four hours each week outside of
  class on your project.
* Remember: You should be sending weekly reports to me and to the four
  mentors *before* each week's class.  (I think we'd all prefer them on
  Wednesday night.)
* Note: If you are bringing a client to campus, it's good to notify the
  other group that is working with that client.  (It may also be useful
  to do the same for off-campus clients.)
* What do you have scheduled today in terms of visits with mentors or
  clients?
* Your first set of Cucumber scenarios (or user stories) are due today,
  as are your selection of those scenarios for working on in this sprint.  
  Do you want the first hour of class to complete that?

### Upcoming Work

* Next week: Reports/Demos to your peers.
    * What scenarios did you complete?
    * What are some interesting coding issues you encountered along 
      the way?
* Next week (and every week): Weekly report 
* I may also provide you with a more detailed project report to fill out.  

### PSA
