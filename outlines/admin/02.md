* Apologies for late notification about r&eacute;sum&eacute;s.
    * My strengths are clearly last-minute improv, and not careful
      pre-planning.
* Project teams formed.
* Alumni visits confirmed for the 17th.  Plan on lunch and dinner with alums,
  if at all possible!
* Work for next week: 
    * Everyone - Overviews of existing codebase - questions, ideas, notes, etc.
        * Resource bank can look at the food pantry code.
    * Board Bank and Grants - Plans for meeting with Ahrens.
* I need someone to work on the simple maintenance of MIST - making sure
  to reboot if it's crashed, gathering usage data, posting things to 
  Facebook, maybe fixing bugs when they appear, whatever.  1-2 hpw max.
  Any interest?  (If so, let me know and apply through PioneerLink.)
